# Violating Local Friendliness
This repository is a work in progress database of research on Wigner's Friend and Local Friendliness. There are many missing! Please do add suggestions.

Please [open a pull request if you'd like to add a new paper](https://github.com/unitaryfund/localfriendliness/edit/main/README.md). We prefer open access links.

## Experiments
Some experimental papers also have theoretical results. In reverse chronological order.
